PolyRat is a library for polynomial and rational approximation.
Formally we can think of [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#Polynomial_functions) as a sum of powers of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x">:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p(x)=\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^m a_kx^k.">

A [rational function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_function) is a ratio of two polynomial functions

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r(x)=\displaystyle\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}=\frac{\sum_{k=0}^m a_kx^k}{\sum_{k=0}^n b_k x^k}.">

The goal of this library is to construct polynomial and rational approximations
given a collection of point data consisting of pairs of 
inputs <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x_j\in \mathbb{C}^d">
and outputs <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y_j\in \mathbb{C}^D">
that minimizes (for example)

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle\min_f \sum_{j=1}^N \|f(x_j) - y_j\|^2_2.">

The ultimate goal of this library is to provide algorithms to construct these approximations
in a variety of norms with a variety of constraints on the approximants.


The **polynomial approximation** problem is relatively straightfoward
as it is a convex problem for any [p-norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#p-norm) with pâ‰¥1.
However, there is still a need to be careful 
in the construction of the polynomial basis for high-degree polynomials
to avoid ill-conditioning.
Here we provide access to a number of polynomial bases:

* tensor-product polynomials based on Numpy (e.g., Monomial, Legendre, etc.);
* [Vandermonde with Arnoldi](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09988) polynomial basis;
* [barycentric Lagrange](https://doi.org/10.1137/S0036144502417715) polynomial bases.

The **rational approximation** problem is still an open research problem.
This library provides a variety of algorithms for constructing rational approximations
including:

* [Adaptive Anderson Antoulas](https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1106122)
* [Sanathanan Koerner iteration](https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.1963.1105517)
* [Stabilized Sanathanan Koerner iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10803)
* [Vector Fitting](https://doi.org/10.1109/61.772353)




## Installation

    > pip install --upgrade polyrat


## Documentation

[Full documentation](https://polyrat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is hosted on Read the Docs.


## Usage

Using PolyRat follows the general pattern of [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
For example, to construct a rational approximation of the tangent function

```python
import numpy as np
import polyrat

x = np.linspace(-1,1, 1000).reshape(-1,1)  # Input data ðŸš¨ must be 2-dimensional
y = np.tan(2*np.pi*x.flatten())            # Output data

num_degree, denom_degree = 10, 10          # numerator and denominator degrees 
rat = polyrat.StabilizedSKRationalApproximation(num_degree, denom_degree)
rat.fit(x, y)
```

After constructing this approximation, we can then evaluate 
the resulting approximation by calling the class-instance

```python
y_approx = rat(x)		# Evaluate the rational approximation on X
```

Comparing this to training data, we note
that this degree-(10,10) approximation is highly accurate
